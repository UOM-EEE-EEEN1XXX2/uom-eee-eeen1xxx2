Feedback
--------
The primary opportunity for getting feedback on your work is in the lab sessions. Be proactive in requesting this. We will have lots of demonstrators on-hand to answer your questions and to give you feedback or suggestions on your work. This will be formative feedback, to help guide your future work. 

The other sources for feedback are:

- Formative: Each lab requires you to upload some code to check your understanding. The online system will compile this, and give some feedback if the code doesn't work as expected.
- Formative: Each topic in the course notes has a short quiz at the end of it. Use these to test your knowledge, moving on to the next topic once you've completed the quiz to your satisfaction.
- Summative: There is a coursework assignment due towards the end of the course. The marks and class feedback will help you to evaluate your work and where you sit within the cohort.
- Summative: There is an unseen exam at the end of the course. The marks and class feedback will help you to evaluate your work and where you sit within the cohort.
